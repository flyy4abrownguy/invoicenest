- Status icons use egg metaphors

### Color Palette

- **Secondary**: Soft amber (#f59e0b)
- **Accent**: Sage green (#10b981)
- **Background**: Cream (#fafaf9)

### Custom Animations

- `nest-settle` - Elements settling into place
- `egg-hatch` - Status change animations
- `weave` - Fade-in like twigs being woven

## Sample Data Currently Shown

The app displays sample data so you can see the full UI:
